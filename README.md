---DISCORD BOT V1 ---

Hey! I am new to discord.js and programming all together. Recently I have taken an interest in coding and the satisfaction when something works!
This bot is VERY simple at the moment, it includes features such as:
  -Music Commands (-Play (key words or link goes here) and -leave)
  -ping
  -youtube (don't even bother with this)
  
In the future I hope to expand this bot and make it somewhat successful!


# HOW TO RUN
