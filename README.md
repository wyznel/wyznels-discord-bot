---DISCORD BOT V1 ---

Hey! I am new to discord.js and programming all together. Recently I have taken an interest in coding and the satisfaction when something works!
This bot is VERY simple at the moment, it includes features such as:
1) Music (-play song name/url and -leave)
2) -ping
3) working on a role add feature which will automatically give a role to a new user!

  
In the future I hope to expand this bot and make it somewhat successful!


# HOW TO RUN
1) Download this as a ".zip"
2) Extract using your preferred program (e.g. 7zip/winrar)
3) Open in your preferred code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
4) Open a new terminal and type - "npm i discord.js ffmpeg opusscript ytdl-core yt-search"
5) Then wait for it to finish installing (shouldn't take long!)
6) Enter your discord bot's token and then head back to the terminal and type "node ."

# WILL THIS BOT BE ONLINE 24/7?
As of now due to difficulties unfortunately it isn't, but I am working towards a permanent fixture for a 247 online bot!

I will update this file and let you know how it is working!
